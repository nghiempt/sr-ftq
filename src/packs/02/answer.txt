A1: The training process was performed using an individual computer implemented with 16 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060Ti graphic card.
---
A2: PyTorch library was used for model development.
---
A3: Epidemiological studies have reported that apical periodontitis is present in 7% of teeth and 70% of the general population.
---
A4: The AI model segmented 63 apical lesions on 47 radiographs in the test data set (True Positives) (Figures 3â€“5). Twelve apical lesions were not detected (False Negatives). In 5 cases without apical lesions, lesions were nevertheless segmented by the AI model (False Positives) (Table 1). The sensitivity, precision, and F1-score values at 70% IoU value were 0.92, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively (Table 2).
---
A5: 470 panoramic radiographs were divided into train, validation, and test group:
(a) Training group: 380
(b) Validation group: 43
(c) Test group: 47
---
A6: Deep learning AI models enable the evaluation of periapical pathology based on panoramic radiographs. The application of AI for apical lesion detection and segmentation can reduce the burden on clinicians.
---
A7: Cropping, Remove full black masks, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Resize
---
A8: Endres et al. [40] created a model using 2902 deidentified panoramic radiographs.
---
A9: Three.
---
A10: The confusion matrix was used to assess the achievement of the model.
