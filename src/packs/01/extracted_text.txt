1.Introduction
Sports resources are an indispensable foundation and
condition for Chinese citizens to exercise, strengthen theirphysique, and enrich their cultural life. However, becauseour country’s productivity is not yet developed and sportsresourcesarestillinshortsupply,itcannotbeaccomplished
overnight. We can only improve this temporary pattern of
inequality in stages and steps.
/Y_his research aims to conduct in-depth research on the
concepts, types, characteristics, and functions of schoolsports resources from the perspective of resource scienceand build a set of school sports resource evaluation systemson the basis of the research. /Y_he evaluation of the indexsystemrevealsurbanandruralareasobjectivegapsinschoolsports resources, providing a realistic reference for thecountry to rationally allocate school sports resources at alllevels and types.
/Y_he application of edge computing in emerging tech-
nologyﬁeldsisbecomingmoreandmorecommon.Xuetal.believed that edge caches are vulnerable to cache pollutionattacks (CPAttacks), leading to interruption of content
delivery. Even according to the CPAttacks model, the cache
statusofedgedevicesischaracterizedbythetwoparametersof content request rate and cache loss rate. However, theirresearch lacks thenecessary data [1]. Luo etal. believed thatvehicle edge computing (VEC) integrates mobile edgecomputing (MEC) into the vehicle network, which canprovide more functions to execute resource-constrainedapplications and reduce the waiting time for connectedHindawi

By introducing Internet of /Y_hings (IoT) technology, smart
cities can achieve energy management through ubiquitousmonitoring and reliable communications. /Y_hey focused ondesigning an IoT-based energy management system basedon an edge computing infrastructure with deep reinforce-ment learning. First, they gave an overview of energymanagementbasedontheInternetof/Y_hingsinsmartcities./Y_hen,they proposed aframeworkand softwaremodel of anIoT system based on edge computing. Although they pro-posed an eﬀective energy dispatching scheme with deepreinforcement learning for the proposed framework, their
research lacks a certain degree of innovation [3]. Cao et al.
believed that, as a supplement to the traditional remotecloud center, the multiaccess edge computing (MEC)deployedinthevicinityofthemobileuserterminalhasbeenregarded as a promising technology for 5G heterogeneousnetworks. In order to adapt to the random and constantlychanging environment, enhanced intelligence (AI) is in-troduced in MEC to make intelligent decisions. Althoughthey also discussed some potential problems of AI in MECfor future work, their research is not accurate enough [4].
/Y_his research mainly discusses the evaluation index sys-
tem of school sports resources based on artiﬁcial intelligence
and edge computing. Human resources, ﬁnancial resources,
andmaterialresourcesinschoolsportsresourcesarethethreemajor resources in resource science. University sports sta-dium information publicity uses Internet technology to es-tablish a sports information management platform andmobile Internet terminals to optimize university sports re-sources and stadium information management services. Ituses artiﬁcial intelligence technology to improve venue in-formation management. It establishes a comprehensiveplatform for venue management information, collects mul-tidimensional information, provides information resources

public ﬁtness needs, and uses edge computing to realize thenearby cloud processing of video data, reducing the jam andblackscreenphenomenoninthelivebroadcastprocessofthegame. /Y_he phenomenon of black screen in the middle of thecaton improves the data computing ability, reduces the de-pendenceontheperformanceoftheuserterminalequipmentitself, builds a smart sports resource platform, and combinesartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to create smart communities andsmart stadiums, and realizes event services and operations inimportant competition venues, intelligent travel, safety pre-
vention, control, and so on.

2.1. Artiﬁcial Intelligence. With the technological develop-
ment of hardware and software equipment, the capabilities
and superiority of artiﬁcial intelligence have rapidlypenetrated all areas of life. /Y_he pattern recognition of ar-tiﬁcial intelligence is the process by which a computer canrecognize and process information from the outside worldby simulating the human senses. In recent years, with therapid development of digital information theory andcomputer technology, people continue to try to process
natural information and convert it into digital signals and
then realize the process of analyzing and processing digitalsignals through computer intelligence. /Y_he role of artiﬁcialintelligence in the course of teacher preparation is mainlyreﬂected in providing teachers with data resources andcreatingvirtualteachingenvironmentmodels./Y_heteacher’slesson preparation is to prepare the classroom, prepare thecontent, and, more importantly, prepare the students.Teachers can obtain students’ learning data through intel-ligent teaching programs and software and intelligentlygenerate academic analysis to help teachers understand

2.2.EdgeComputing. Mobileedgecomputing(MEC),asakey
technology for the evolution of 4.5G/5G network architecture,
can meet the system’s requirements for throughput, delay,networkscalability,andintelligence.Atpresent,mostofthetaskmigration problems are researched in the cloud computingenvironment and the mobile edge computing environment. Inthe migration process in the cloud computing environment,most of the hosts with intensive computing tasks are detected,and some or all of the tasks on them are migrated to physicalserverswithsuﬃcientcomputingresources./Y_hetaskoﬄoadingprocess performed inthe mobile edge computing environment

2.3.SportsResources. Nowadays,collegesportsresourcesare
mainly manifested in the rich resources of venues and fa-
cilitiesandstrongsportsprofessionalteachersandstudents.However, most of the sports resources of colleges anduniversities are used to develop education and scientiﬁc
research, they have not assumed the function of serving the
society,andthemanagementsystemislagging[20].Forthisreason, the concept of sustainable development of collegesports venues in the new era should be realized so that thelimited sports venue resources can better meet the sportsactivities needs of teachers, students, and the majority ofcommunityresidentsandpromotethehealthydevelopmentof physical ﬁtness [21]. Sports resources in colleges anduniversities involve a wide range of areas, which can be
roughly summarized into three aspects: teacher and student
resources,venueresources,andfundingresources.Withthein-depth development of theconcept of national ﬁtness,thepublicity of sports ﬁtness knowledge and scientiﬁc andtechnological services are also sports resources for collegesanduniversitiestoprovideservicestocommunityresidents.Among them, material resources refer to sports venues andequipment, and human resources refer to teachers andstudents majoring in physical education in colleges anduniversities,aswellasteachersandstudentswhoarekeentoservemasssports[22,23]./Y_heprocessingofsportsresources

Although school sports information is not as broad as
sports information, school sports information is a transit
point for the acquisition of school sports information andthe dissemination of sports information [23, 25]. Whencalculating sports resources, the overall information com-bined with local features can be obtained.
3.School Sports Resource
Evaluation Experiment
3.1. School Sports Resource Indicators. Human resources,
ﬁnancial resources, and material resources in school sports
resources are the three major resources in resource science.
/Y_his study takes time resources as the ﬁrst-level index of theschool sports resource evaluation system. School sports hu-man resources include physical education teachers, sportsmanagers, and physical education assistants. Human re-sources in the school sports resource evaluation system areused as the ﬁrst-level indicators; physical education teachers,sportsmanagers,andphysicaleducationassistantsareusedasthesecond-levelindicatorsfortheevaluationofschoolsportshumanresources;theindicatorsfortheevaluationofphysicaleducation teachers (third-level indicators) are mainly from:
age, education, professional title, profession, workload,
training, clothing equipment, monthly income, and teacher-student ratio, 9 subindicators for evaluation. /Y_he evaluationindex (three-level index) of school physical education man-agers and school physical education assistants is mainlyevaluated from the four subindices of age, educationalbackground, major, and professional title, which constitutethe school physical human resource evaluation system.

equipment. Information resources: newspapers, magazines,
books, and network resources. Time resources: physicaleducation classes, sports competitions, and extracurricularactivities.
3.2. Optimization of Venue Information Publicity Services.
Venue information publicity services eﬀectively improveresidents’ sports awareness and facilitate residents to obtainhigh-quality sports services, venue information publicityservices, venue information publicity content, includingphysical exercise methods, sports policies and regulations,and the latest sports trends; venue information publicityforms, blackboard newspapers, publicity columns, andpostpropaganda slogans; and venue information propa-ganda media, such as TV, the Internet, and magazines, invarious forms to increase public ﬁtness and sports aware-
ness. University sports stadium information publicity uses
Internet technology to establish a sports informationmanagement platform and mobile Internet terminals tooptimize university sports resources and stadium infor-mation management services. It uses artiﬁcial intelligencetechnology to improve venue information management. Itestablishes a comprehensive platform for venue manage-ment information, collects multidimensional information,provides information resources and accurate informationpush,linksvenueinformationwithpublicﬁtnessneeds,anduses edge computing to realize the nearby cloud processing
of video data, reducing the jam and black screen phe-
nomenon in the live broadcast process of the game. /Y_hephenomenon of a black screen in the middle of the freezeimproves the data computing ability and reduces the per-formance dependence on the user terminal device itself. Itpromotes cooperation between management systems, dy-namically updates monitoring in real time, completes real-time monitoring of venues and users, feeds back, improveswork, and achieves professional and intelligent manage-ment. Information collection, information sharing, infor-mation push, opinion feedback and dynamic monitoring,
and so forth are multifunctional and coordinated to form a
complete information management system, building a5G+smart sports resource platform. /Y_he 5G+smart sportsresourceplatformmainlybuildsa5Gnetworkenvironmentforthestadiumsandvenues.Withthehelpofvirtualization,artiﬁcial intelligence, edge computing and other technolo-gies,itcreatesa5Gsmartapplicationplatformforthegame,combining artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to create smart com-munities and smart stadiums in important competitionvenues to realize the intelligentization of competition ser-vices, operation, and security prevention and control.
3.3. Internet+University Stadium Resources. With the ap-
plicationofInternetinformationtechnologyinallaspectsof
life, APP applications such as Alipay, Didi, and WeChatprovide convenience for people’s lives. /Y_hrough the use ofInternet technology, the blind spots of the public ﬁtnesspractitionersontheresourcesofthestadiumareeliminated,the connection between the college stadiums and the publicﬁtness practitioners has been strengthened, and a goodcommunication platform has been established. Build anInternet+university stadium resource sharing informationtechnology platform, which can be designed to includeinformation, venue name, venue location, venue openingservice time, charging standards, service items, and servicepersonnel; it can be designed to include reservations, venue
reservations, and appointment service coaches and can be
designed to include sports information, push the latestservice items, push tips on preventing sports injuries, pushthemethodsandmethodsofcorrectphysicalexercise,andsoon. /Y_hrough the Internet technology, we will providetechnologicalinnovationstothestadiumsofuniversitiesandcolleges and return the resources of the stadiums to sportsandtothepeople./Y_heprincipleofsmarteventlivebroadcastis shown in Figure 1.
During the live broadcast of the student sports league,
multiple live cameras are used for simultaneous video
shooting. /Y_he multiple channels of video are combined by
the live encoder and uploaded to the cloud computingcluster through RTMP. /Y_he production of 6DOF video isrealizedthroughthe3Dreconstructionalgorithm,andthenthe video is passed through RTMP upstream to the livebroadcast center. When the user terminal chooses to enter6DOFvideoplayback,theedgecloudﬁndstheclosestMECedge computing node through the scheduling service, theuser uploads the live or on-demand ID and user viewingangle to the MEC edge node, the MEC edge node pulls thecorresponding 6DOF live HLS stream, download is real-ized,andafterdownloadinganddecoding,thevideostream
of the corresponding angle is calculated by the algorithm

In the entire link,the 3D rendering and reconstruction of the video rely onthe technical integration of the telecom edge cloud com-puting MEC and the cloud edge computing operatingsystem, use edge computing to realize nearby cloud pro-cessingofvideodata,improvedatacomputingcapabilities,reduce the performance dependence on user terminalequipmentitself,furtheroptimizethenetworkdelayofuseraccess, and more calmly deal with large traﬃc and high
concurrency while reducing the center. In this way, it can
betterrespondtothepressureoflargebroadbandandlow-latency service requirements faced in large-scale Internetscenarios such as live events, variety shows, and onlineeducation.

4.Results and Discussion
Sports venues and equipment are symbols of colleges anduniversities’landmarksandfunctions./Y_heyaremainlyusedfor daily teaching, competitive training, physical exercisesfor teachers and students, and important venues for ex-tracurricularactivities./Y_herefore,theimplementationoftheconstruction and standardization of sports venue resourcesin colleges and universities is conducive to not only pro-moting college sports but also improving the quality of
scientiﬁc research and teaching training, providing a core
foundation for “lifelong sports.” /Y_he number of sportsvenues in province M has increased from 19277 to 40103,among which the number of college sports venues has in-creased from 776 to 2,143. It can be seen that the con-structionofsportsvenuesinprovinceMhascloselyfollowedthe national policy requirements for the development ofhealthy China. It not only provides convenient services inthe teaching process of teachers and students but alsoprovides potential new resources for national ﬁtness. In-formation about sports venues and equipment is shown in
Table 1.
/Y_he age structure of sports managers is shown in
Figure2.Judgingfromthedistributionoftheagestructure
of sports managers, whether it is a city or a townshipschool, the age structure is more reasonable. /Y_he pro-portion of 50–59 years old and under 30 years old is small,mainly distributed in the two age groups 30–39 years oldand40–49years old;thesetwoagegroupsaretheidealageformanagers(1.Haverichexperience,2./Y_hebestagetodoa career)./Y_he part-time situation of school physical education
teachersisshowninTable2.Duringtheinvestigation,itwasfound that the part-time school physical education teachermainlyassiststheworkofthePoliticalandEducationOﬃceand participates in the management of students in theschool. /Y_he part-time situation of urban middle schoolteachers is higher than that of township schools, and the
workload of urban and rural teachers is unbalanced. It is
necessary to improve the part-time situation of physicaleducation teachers in urban schools so that they can devotethemselves to their own work.
For colleges and universities, the age structure of
teachers reﬂects the current education situation to a certainextent.Youngteachersinjectnewvitalityandnewideasintocolleges and universities and stimulate students’ interest inlearning.Teacherswithhighteachingagehaverichteachingknowledge and teaching training experience. /Y_he ability ofscientiﬁc research and innovation can also provide young
teacherswithteachingtraining,scientiﬁcresearch,andother
experience, providing a basis for high-quality teaching. /Y_hesituationofphysicaleducationteachersofallagegroupsin5universities is as follows: about 11.7% under the age of 29;about 55.9% between 30 and 39 years; about 21.8% between40 and 49 years; and 10.6% 50 years and above. From thedata,itcanbeseenthatthedistributionofthethreestagesofold, middle, and youth is relatively reasonable, with thelargest number of people between the ages of 31 and 40.From the perspective of physiology and psychology, thisperiod belongs to the golden stage, which is full of energy
and is more conducive to colleges and universities. /Y_he

shows that the number of teaching assistants is 84, ac-
countingforapproximately14.4%;thenumberoflecturersis187, accounting for approximately 32.1%; the associateprofessor level is 234, accounting for approximately 40.2%;
professors are 77, accounting for about 13.3%. /Y_hrough the
statisticalanalysis,inthe5collegesanduniversitiescurrentlysurveyed, the trend of professional titles of physical edu-cation teachers provides young teachers with a multi-development platform. /Y_he titles of various college teachersare shown in Figure 3.
/Y_he educational background of school physical educa-
tion teachers is shown in Table 4. /Y_he educational level notonlyrepresentsthelevelofaperson’seducationandculturebut also interprets the individual’s knowledge, ability, andskill practice level. /Y_herefore, the academic structure ofphysical education teachers in colleges and universities canindicate the ability of the school in teaching practice,competitive training, and scientiﬁc research results. As canbe seen from Table 4, undergraduates accounted for 26.9%,masters accounted for 60.3%, and doctoral degrees
accounted for 12.8%. It can be seen from the data that the
current overall level of physical education teachers in col-legesanduniversitieshasreachedacertainheight,whichcanbringgreatereducationalvaluetotheteaching,training,andscientiﬁc research of colleges and universities and provide adriving force for the good development of colleges anduniversities.
/Y_he charging situation of the university sports resource
ﬁeldisshowninFigure4.Allsportsresourcesincollegesanduniversities are not open to the outside world, which aﬀectsthe sports of residents in surrounding communities to a
certain extent; the resource venues for public welfare open
services only account for 9.4%, and paid services and somepaid services account for 28.7% and 14.23%, respectively./Y_he venues for external services are mostly outdoor venues,such as table tennis, badminton courts, and venues for thethree major sports. /Y_he management costs of these venuesare relatively low, and the open objects are mainly for theteachers and students of the school and surrounding resi-dents; most of the paid openings are indoors. Venue re-sources, such as swimming pools, ping-pong halls,gymnasiums, and tennis courts, are due to the special re-quirements of site materials, management personnel costs,
andmaintenancecosts,socorrespondingfeesarechargedto
reduce the burden on the school.
Table 5 shows the form of external services of uni-
versity sports venues. It can be seen from Table 5 that60.3% of the resources provided by some college sportsvenues provide free services to the outside world, in-cluding outdoor track and ﬁeld courts, basketball courts,ping-pong and badminton tennis courts, and gymnasi-ums. /Y_hrough investigation, it is found that, under thepremise of not aﬀecting normal teaching and training,mostoftheoutdoorvenuesincollegesanduniversitiesare
open, providing free services to teachers, students, and
surrounding residents. However, 39.7% of sports venuesare paid services, basically indoors. /Y_he main reason forthefeeisthedailycleaningofthevenueandtherepairandmaintenance of the equipment. If all are open, the uni-versity will bear the relevant costs while taking the safetyfactor. For this reason, the university venues chargecorresponding fees when serving residents to exercise. Inthe investigation, it was found that some venues under-took various forms of competitions during a certain idletime, and charged certain fees in accordance with the
standards to pay for the management staﬀ’s labor costs
and daily maintenance costs.
/Y_heopening hoursofschoolsports resourcesare shown
in Figure 5. Among them, 6–8 in the morning and 17–19 inthe afternoon accounted for 27.2% and 24.6%, respectively,19–22 at night accounted for 29.8%, and 12–14 at noonaccounted for about 18.4%.

needs to be solved urgently.
/Y_he external service statistics of sports venue resources

Facing the current dilemma in thedevelopmentofcommunitysports,collegesanduniversitiesshould cater to the requirements of the country, change theold ideas, take into account the overall situation, and meetresidents’ expectations for the opening of college resources.
Insomecollegesanduniversities,theservicestatusofsports
scientiﬁc research platform resources is not optimistic.According to the data, only 13.1% of them serve commu-nities. For this reason, it is the most important task of thelocal government to break through the old view of collegesports scientiﬁc research resources serving communitysports. School sports resource sharing is shown in Table 6.

5.Conclusion
/Y_his research mainly discusses the evaluation index systemofschoolsportsresourcesbasedonartiﬁcialintelligenceandedge computing. Human resources, ﬁnancial resources, andmaterial resources in school sports resources are the threemajor resources in resource science. /Y_his research aims toestablish a comprehensive platform for venue managementinformation, collect multi-dimensional information, pro-vide information resources, push accurate information, andlink venue information with public ﬁtness needs, andcombined with artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to create smart
communities,smartvenues,andrealizeanintelligentservice
system integrating important event venues, event services,intelligent operation and travel, and safety prevention andcontrol. During the live broadcast of the student sportsleague, the nearby cloud processing of video data is realizedin the form of edge computing, which improves the datacomputingabilityandreducestheperformancedependenceon the user terminal equipment itself. In future researchwork, the competent government departments at all levelsshould play an active role in guiding and vigorously ad-vocating the national sports open policy. Schools should
actively create innovations based on their own school site
resources and without aﬀecting the safety of teaching andtraining./Y_heconditionsareopentothepublic,thesocietyisthe platform to meet the needs of bodybuilders, and rea-sonable opening hours and charging standards areformulated.
