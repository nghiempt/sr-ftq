We develop software and services for photo editing. When using the software and services, we may provide you access to content that we licensed from our partners, and allow you to search photos from all over the web. You own all the rights for your works, but if you do not have a specific permission to use an image, we can’t provide you with that permission.
The content we licensed through our collections is provided with a license (as detailed in the full terms). If you import content from outside our collections (including via our web-search or custom fonts), you may do so, but you are required to receive permission from the copyright holders. This means that we don’t claim any ownership of your images.
Also, we may allow you to backup your photos, or to share them with your friends via other social networks, all according to functionality of the services.
Please take note that when using our services some information may be processed by third parties: photos may be processed by image processing services, statistical information may be collected by our service providers and technical information may be collected for improving the service.
Lastly, this service is made on an AS-IS basis; we can’t be held liable for any damage: not if your phone heats up and blows, not if your data is lost and not if your photos are published on the web publicly.

This means that you cannot use a cellphone you received from the workplace in order to install this application without your employer’s consent; (iii) you are not a sex offender, nor have you been convicted with any violent crime or any crime against your children.
2. There Is No Mandatory Signup. We do not coerce you into signing up for the service. We encourage it.
