User data is stored by Brave only when Rewards or Sync is switched on. This document explains how the Brave Browser uses data. You can understand our data usage for operation of our websites, forums, and communications by visiting the Website Privacy Policy. Likewise, data usage for publishers and creators is outlined in the Publisher Privacy Policy.
""We"", ""us"", etc. refer to Brave Software Inc, while ""Brave"" refers to the browser. Brave periodically checks for updates with us, allowing access to the latest security fixes. These requests help us compile aggregate statistics, without revealing individual data.
For browsing safety, the Brave Browser uses Google Safe Browsing, storing URL hashes locally on your device. To protect against Google profiling or tracking, these requests are proxied through Brave’s servers. Users can adjust their Safe Browsing settings on their device.
Brave's Sync feature, when enabled, saves your bookmarks, passwords, and other data in an encrypted file on a cloud storage service. This data is inaccessible to Brave and to the cloud storage provider. If a website seeks to determine your location while you're using Brave, your IP address, providing an approximation of your location, can be sent on your approval. This data may be stored by the visited website but not by Brave.
In case of enabling Brave Rewards, we assign your Brave browser a “Rewards Payment ID,” for accounting Basic Attention Token (BAT) rewards. BAT transaction details are subject to the privacy policies of our custodial partners (for example, Uphold, Gemini, bitFlyer, or ZebPay). However, we never collect browsing history and can not link contributors to content creators or sites.
Our secure crypto wallet, Brave Wallet, allows users to buy, send, store, and swap assets across various blockchain networks. Brave does not track any actions made in the wallet, and the IP address associated with wallet access is proxied and stripped. Some transaction data might be processed by Decentralised Exchange Aggregators, but only used for fulfilling transactions.
The processing of personal data across various features and tools, like Brave Talk, Brave Firewall + VPN, Web Discovery Project, etc., is done considering necessity, legitimate interests of both Brave and users, and contract performance. We don't retain IP addresses associated with our translation service's requests, and any submitted text is not kept after completion of the request.
We collect minimal information necessary to provide the service and do so in a privacy-preserving manner. Furthermore, we take various measures to safeguard personal data and do not share any confidential information with third parties.
From 2021, we have an EU nominated representative for addressing privacy concerns. Users can ask for information about their data, update it, delete it, object to its use, or request a copy. Policy updates will be announced as needed. Users uncomfortable with changes can choose to stop using Brave.
For privacy settings help in Brave, please visit the Help Center. You can join in-depth conversations at community.brave.com, and for privacy-related queries, contact privacy@brave.com}.","I. Data Shared:
