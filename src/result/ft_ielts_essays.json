First, in 1995, cities represented the major percentage of habitat by roughly 50 percent, followed by rural areas and towns came in last, among people born in Australia. On the other hand, people born outside Australia, cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent, followed by rural areas and towns. In 2010, among people born in Australia, cities had an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and a major decrease in towns and rural areas. Conversely, people born outside Australia, cities had the most percentage among both studies, followed by rural areas and towns."

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries."

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.\nMoney is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.\nBut money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.\nDevevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.\nOverall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty."

Although, visits to Europeans lakes demostrated more changes over the 20 years than its counterparts.\nIn more detail, the most steady growth was experienced by the visits to Europeans mountains. For example, from 1987 the number of visitors grew from 20,000 to almost the double 20 years later. Similarly, visits to the coast also rose after a slight fall in 1992, reaching almost twice as much since 1987, with 75,000.\nThose visiting Europeans lakes subtantially increased over the years from 10 thousand to a peak of 75 thousand in 2002. Despite falling for about 25 thousand in 2007, the visitis to this place remained higher compared to 1987, with 50,000 at the end of the period."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.\nThose supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.\nOn the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.\nIn my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.\nIn conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people."

It's clear from the graph, that generally the coast area have the highest number of visitors all over the years.\nAccording to what is shown in the linear figure in 1987 period visitors first place was the coast with 40 visitor and in seconed place was the mountains with half number of coast's visitors and the lakes became lastly.\nWhile the statistics have been changed at 2002 , the lakes sharply increased to be the first place by reaching the highest number of it's visitors, and the coast is the seconed.\nFinally at 2007 , the coast speedly increased to be most place having tourists and the lakes dramaticlly declined to take the seconed place. The rules switched between coast and lakes numbers.\nTo sum up , the linear graph describe a constantly change in mountains visitors numbers , and sharply changes in coast and lakes visitors numbers."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: Sports is an essential part to most of us , some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income , So it's a huge part in our live.\nBuilding specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.\nAthelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.\nSports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.\nIn conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision. In other hand , raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.\nOn the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.\nOn the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.\nTo sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone."

The data compare figures recorded in 1987 until 2007.\nOverall, the coast had the greatest number of visitors in the first year and will continue until the end of the study. Meanwhile, among the three locations, mountains were noted to be the least among the categories.\nIn detail, at the start of the year, the coast was noted to be the highest with 40 thousand visitors in 1987. In the succeeding year, it had slightly decreased to 35 thousand. However, it had a sharp increased in number in follwing years and reached almost 80 thousand visitors at 2007\nThe lakes were observed to be in lowest number of tourists who visited the location, at a number of 10 thousand in 1987, and this was followed by people who went to the mountains with 20 thousand visitors on the same year. However, in 1992 the two locations had identical pattern which rose up to over 20 thousand visitors respectively. The mountains had a slightly contuinuous increasing pattern throughout the remaining years ending with 35 thousand visitors.

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.\nBeing able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.\nIn addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.\nIn conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: It is often argued that some countries invist in devolping highly specialised training centers to train its top athletes to achieve international sports, instead of facilitate and provide public training centers for everyone to use and to practice. In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.\nBuilding highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.\nOn the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.\nIn conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: There is some countries attain international sports by making and buliding unique specialised facilities to develop and improve top athletes, rather than providing sports facilities that anyone else can use.\nIn my opinion, i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development, i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food, because a good physique can improve movement,stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football, basketball, table tennis, swimming etc, and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity.\nbuiliding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best, also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people, every athlete with his coach, and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes, as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better, they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc, and they have the coaches all over the place, and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes.\nadditionally those player have to be very fit, all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired.\nSo yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches."

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.\n\nAnswer: Information is presented in two pie charts which compare the amount of time, in percentage, that employees spent on six different activities in a country between 1958 and 2008.\nOverall, it can be clearly seen that while each activity that working adults did experienced a wide variety of changes, working and sleeping were the most and the second most popular categories in both years respectively. In addition, the most significant change in employees\u2019 behavior was travelling to work.\nTurning to first main feature, working ranked first in activity that working adults spent their time on over the survey period, contributing to 33% in 1958 and 42% in 2008. Next, sleeping ranked second in the activity that employees did. In 1958 the amount of time that employees slept was an exact 32%, before decreasing slightly to a precise 25% in 2008.\nTurning to another main feature, with respect to going out, the popularity of this activity decreased noticeably from a modest 19% in 1958 to only 6% in 2008. Nevertheless, there was also an increase of 5% in relaxing at home. In 1958 only 8% of working adults spent their time on this activity. After that the popularity of this activity rose to a modest 13% in 2008. The last key point to note is travelling to work which rose fourfold from a precise 2% in 1958 to an exact 8% in 2008."

                "content": "Question: Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: There is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university, there are only a few students who want to study science, leading to numerous negative effects on community. With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects.\nIt is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead.\nIt is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly.\nIn conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society."

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.\n\nAnswer: The two diagrams compare the proportion of time spent by adult workers in a specific country on different activities over a 50-year period, from 1958 to 2008.\nOverall, it can clearly be seen that in 1958, adult workers divided their time roughly equally between work, sleep, and other activities. However, over the next five decades, there was a remarkable increase in working hours, a significant decrease in sleep time, and the total time allocated to other activities remained nearly unchanged.\nIt is surprising that adult workers spent almost the same amount of time sleeping (32%) as they did working (33%) in 1958. However, by 2008, they slept 7% less (25%) and worked 9% more (42%), which represents a remarkable increase in working hours. As a result, the time they spent at home for relaxation increased from 8% to 13%. In contrast, the time spent going out with friends and family declined dramatically by one-third, from 19% to 6%. The most striking change, however, was the significant increase in time spent traveling to work, which quadrupled from 2% to 8% over the 50 years."

                "content": "Question: Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.\nThe first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.\nConsequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.\nTo sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine."

However, people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958, which was 2% though by 2008 people started spending 8% of their time commuting to work.\nIt is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one-fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time-consuming activity. On the contrary, in 2008, this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6% of the time. People also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32% to 25%."

What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: In this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities. There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.\nThe main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.\nEventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.\nTo conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for Science Subjects in coming future. Otherwise, it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country."

However, the time of other three activities consumed were decreased at the same time.\nIn terms of the events which experienced an increasement of time, the percentage of time of working rised 9 percent, up to 42 percentage in 2008 and become the most time-consuming activity. The activities of relaxing at home and other interests or playing sports were seperately increased 5 percentage and 2 percentage in terms of time consuming.\nAs regards to going out, travel to work and sleeping activities, they were all decreased in different percentage of time. The most noticiable one was going out with friends or family, which dramatically droped from 19 percentage to 6 percentage, approximately one third of the former proporation in 1958. As for the percentage of sleeping and travel to work, they were both declined over the given fifty years."

What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.\nIn terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.\nHowever, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.\nIn conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future."

Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.\nHowever, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958."

What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.\nThe main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.\nThis trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community.

Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.\nHowever, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958."

                "content": "Question: Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.\nThe main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.\nThis trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country.

We can see that people spent more time relaxing at home and on other interests in 2008 compared to 1958.\nIn 1958, people spent one-third of the time working, which increased in 2008 by 9% and it remained the top priority among working adults. However, people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958, which was 2% though by 2008 people started spending 8% of their time commuting to work.\nIt is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one-fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time-consuming activity. On the contrary, in 2008, this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6% of the time. People also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32% to 25%."

What are the effects on society?\n\nAnswer: In recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for Science or Mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. There are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. In this essay, I will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.\nThe main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. STEM teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue STEM subjects, they will develop Math or Science phobia. Subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.\nEventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. Firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. Eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take STEM subjects in university, there will not be STEM teachers to teach future generation. According to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. There must be some training program to keep STEM teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.\nTo conclude, I believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for STEM subjects in recent future. Otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country."

Water is then sent to a water filter, which roughly purify water from dust, pebbles and other bigger particles.\nSubsequently, water is collected into a giant underground storage, waiting to be sent into the water treatment tank. In there, chemicals are added into the water to make it potable. Finally, drinking water is sent back to houses through a piping system."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.\nFirst of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.\nIn addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.\nIn conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There's an opinion around the ideal way to encourage and teach youngesters how to develop cooperetion skills and that is through team sports at educational facilities. I completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view.\nA very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones.\nExperiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives."

When it rains, the water moves along the roof drainage, and pipes lead into the water filter. Next, the water filter removes basic pollutants, such as leaves and sediments, and begins the first step of water purification. After that, the water flows into a large square water storage tank and then inflows to the next tank for treatment. When enough rainwater enters the treatment tank, chemical substances are injected through a small device on top of the tank to sterilize and ensure the safety of water quality. Once the water is fully purified, it is pumped into the house as a source of drinking water."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.\nFirstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.\nSecondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.\nIn conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children."

Once there, the water has to undergo the filter, which mechanically removes its impurities. This is the initial cleaning step for rainwater.\nThe water is then poured into a storage tank, waiting for the next cleaning experience. In this stage, it is transported to the water treatment. Chemicals are essential for this process as they will deeply remove the residue that cannot be washed by the water filter and make water fit for consumption. Finally, the water experiencing double cleaning process, is delivered to households for different daily utilization. And once it is used and becomes rain, it goes through the recycling process all over again."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.\nInitially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.\nAnother point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.\nFinally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.\nIn conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach."

                "content": "Question: The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.\nIt is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team\u2019s goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.\nIn spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others\u2019 point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation."

Of those millions of travels, Europe represented the highest and the Middle East represented the lowest.\nOne of the most notorious characteristics of the table was the increase in the total of travels from 448.9 million in 1990 to 693.7 million in 2005. European travelled the most during the 15-years period, accounting for 400.2 million in 2005, accounting for around third-fifths of the total. Those in the Middle East went to overseas more too, but they remained with the lowest numbers from 9.8 in 1990 to 15.8 million in 2005.\nIn Africa, Asia and the pacific regions the international visits experienced growth during the 15 years. The former grew by 10,000 milion and the latter by more than the double in 2005. Similarly, those in America travelled more during the first 10 years, however, they experienced a slight drop of 5 million at the end of the period."

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers.\nOne of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too.\nAnother point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career.\nIn conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers. Besides, as the population is rapidly increasing, the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too, so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance."

In four of these countries the trend showed increases. Futhermore, Europeans represented the highest numbers of travels overseas, whereas Middle East represented the lowest.\nThe total number showed increases throughout the whole period. In 1990, 448.9 million people travelled abroad and at the end of the period it reached to 693.7 in total.\nAfrican travellers started with 18.2 million in 1990 and ended with 10.5 million more in 2005.

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.\nQualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.\nFurthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area."

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.\nDue to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.\nOn the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.\nIn my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.\nIn conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees."

Europe obviously received the highest number of vistors compared to the other four areas, while the number of vistors who went to Africa and Middle East are the two latest regions.\nIt is no doubt that the date of people who travel to Europe was the highest, with 280.2, 390.3, 393.2 and 400.2 million respectively in the four periods. At the same time, the number of people travelling to America took the second place, with 80.5, 112.5, 118.2 and 113.2 million respectively.\nFor Africa, the number of travellers took the fourth place, with 18.2, 20.8, 26.9 and 28.7 million respectively during the mentioned four years. Moreover, we can see clearly that the number of people who perfer to travel to Middle East was the lowest data, with only 9.8, 11.3, 13.5 and 15.8 million respectively."

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.\nIt is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.\nSome people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.\nIn conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people."

Discuss both views and give your own opinion\n\nAnswer: According to some people administration should stop the sports that are risky, while few others have an opinion that individuals should have liberty to perform any kind of sports or activity. In my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters.\nFirstly, the sports activities which are risky, should be banned by the government as, they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop. Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die.\nSecondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed.\nAs a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.\nIn conculsion, the risky sports activities should banned and government should only allow the events with keeping the risk in mind and the after effects of the activity that what influence will it have on people of diiferent age criteria."

Discuss both views and give your own opinion\n\nAnswer: The increasing prevalence of furious sports has been a great concern. Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.\nOn the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.\nOn the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.\nFinally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.\nConclusively, I personally believe the solution is not about whether the Governments should forbid furious sports activities, but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement."

At the first glance, it is clear that the number of femails who are involved in some kinds of home tasks are higer than the figure of men houseworkers, while the percentage of time that people useally spend on this kind of work accounted as proporsionally simmelar.\nThe first chart depicts that women cooke and clean by 20 per cent more than men, but the latter repairs house more often than the former. Pet caring involve femails and mails approximately the same.\nThe second chart shows that the number of hours spending by citizens in there household is proportional with first chart figuers. Avarage time to cooking for instance is the same. 80 per cent of women spend 80 minutes per day for cooking. And above 20 per cent of men spend almost 20 minutes for house repairing every day.\nSumming up, more women than men deffinately work harde in households in this country."

Discuss both views and give your own opinion\n\nAnswer: This is true that some people are sure that civil servants should avoid harmful sport activites, but other part of sosiety thinks that individuals should have freedom to choice any sport that they like. I am in two minds on this, but probably governments should take care of their citizens and be responsible for human lives.\nFirstly, extrem sports are very popular above young generation in all over the world and these kinds of activity are the huge part of pastime for thousands people. Risk's lovers spend planty of time and enormous amount of money to feel freadom and to try themselfs as a brave and strong persons. For instance, in my country such sports as rock jumping, mountain cyicling and BMX are very popular. And even if these activites are dangerous, young men and women are keen on it, and they are against the governments who wants to ban this sports.\nOn the other hand, adult people always want to protect younger ones. To my point of thinking protection is significant habbit of human beings that we need to respect. However, governments, who try to ban dangerous sports, need to be more flexible, and not only say no for harmful sports, but involve young generation in activites that are not so risky. I also belive that media attention can make seance about all cons of extrem choice, becouse information about number of death between exrem sportmens can be helpful.\nSumming up, the buning dangerous sports topic is rather complecation and importaint issue. I suppose that, the sosiety need recive more information about harmful sports, while governments have to be more responsible in building anouth common sport facilities."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: In developed country, economic wealth is not an issue for them. Some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. I partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. However money is still the driving force to well-beings.\nThe statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. Economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. However, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. These are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. Degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.\nOn the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. For government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. For examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. Secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. The military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. Thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. If we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.\nIn conclusion, I believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There are various numbers of countries that are rich from an economic weath such as petroleum, gas, and minerals. In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.\nFirstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.\nFurthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.\nTo conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Economist is often suggest that when the country is fully economically developed , any excessive economy does not make its people to be more satisfied.However some experts discuss this point of view differently.In my suggesttion, i strongly disagree to this point of view.In this essay i will point out the reason why the developed country have satisfied citizens regardless of additional in economic wealth.\nFirst of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time\nAnother reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.\nAddition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.\nIn conclution, its obvious the fact that addition economy in the developed country is not the only factor to make its people satisfiable.There are number of factor including political stability, good government leadership but few to mention.However in my opinion i believe additional economy in economically giant country dramatically contribute to satification of majority of citizens."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Some people argue that if a country is rich enough, then the residents will not be satisfied by the increase in economic wealth. From my point of view, I completely disagree this opinion.\nFirstly, there still has a gap between rich and poor people in the reach country. As the economic situation of a country is getting better and better, it is true that most of the people would like to believe that all the residents will live a happy ever life. But still, there must be some people struggle to manage their life. Take China as an example, the GDP of China saw a dramatic increase in the recent years, people in the mega cities or the first level cities like Beijing and Shanghai do not worry about their food anymore, and can enjoy their high quality life. However, there still has some poor citizens who live in the small city and trying their best to feed their children. These poor people may not earn enough salaries or lost their job, thus, any addiction increase in economic wealth may be an opportunity for them, which can makes them feel satisfied enough.\nSecondly, the growth in economic will make residents richer than before. People are living in the material world, no one will refuse the economic wealth to make their life better. A rich country means most of the residents in this country is middle or above middle class, an increase in the economic wealth means they can get a better house, send their children to a better school, spend more time on leisure activity instead of working, for all these benefits that the economic growth bring to them, they would fell satisfied.\nIn conclusion, I believe that in the rich country, people are still satisfied the increase in economic wealth, as this can reduce the gap between rich and poor people, and allow citizens to enjoy their life better."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There is no doubt that these days the rich country is important to developed their cities and improve their young people skills. The question is how when a country is already rich if increase any additional in economy its citizens any more satisfied, What is happen in the future? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.\nIn terms of problems, the most population in rich country, They not feel to under them which income in their country. The main reason given to support this claim is that they usually comfortable life and request additional, subsequently they not engurage to support the limit people income. To illustrate, In Japan the population most of them is selfish, They not donate or help the limit people income. In other words the rich countries when additional increase in economy is become negative things.\nHowever, The some rich countries is support young people and donate to poor countries. Firstly, UK is support its population in terms of sports. In other words they built several sport facilities to support official clubs and public people. For instance, Football fields in public places, which the more people saves their health. Secondly, In France it has some factories for make the cars, And bring students from the cars college to the factories because take experience before graduation. Also, some of the young people they has unique hobby, subsequently rich country it can spent money to support talent young.\nIn conclusion, although the rich countries when received any additional to increase economy dose not make any more satisfied. Therefore, I believe that increase in economy in rich countries it is necessary to developed the country and their different population."

Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.\nTo sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: An increasing number of individuals are taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery in order to achieve a better appearance. I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society.\nTo begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift.\nAdditionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past.\nTo conclude, harmful mass media advertising and lower costs of cosmetic surgery translate into a negative development in our communities due to mental health issues and citizens spending money on nonsense. I would strongly recommend that authorities create laws to regulate mass media advertising."

In addition, while Brisbane experiences a wide variety of changes in the average number of raining days, the figure for days with rainfall in Canberra remains unchanged approximately.\nTurning to the first main feature in the line graph, in February Brisbane reached the highest average maximum temperature of an exact 30 degrees Celsius, whereas the average maximum temperature in Canberra is about 3 degrees Celsius less than that in Brisbane. The average maximum temperature in Brisbane then falls noticeably and levels off at around just above 20 degrees Celsius until July. On the other hand, the figure for the average maximum temperature in Canberra decreases substantially to a little more than 10 degrees Celsius which is the lowest point. By December, the average maximum temperature in both Brisbane and Canberra rises considerably to just below 30 and about 27 degrees Celsius respectively.\nWith respect to the average minimum temperature, there is a temperature fluctuation in both cities throughout the year. In January, the average minimum temperature in Brisbane and Canberra is just above 20 and about 13 degrees Celsius respectively. The figure for the average minimum temperature then drops remarkably to the lowest point of 10 degrees Celsius in Brisbane and nearly zero in Canberra in July. By the end of the period, the temperature bounce back to almost the same level as in January.\nTurning to the key feature in the line graph, Brisbane reached the highest average number of raining days of a precise 14 days in February which maintains the same level until March. Then the average number of raining days in Brisbane drops substantially and levels off at approximately 7 days which is the lowest number, before rising to 12 days in December. On the contrary, Canberra experiences a period of stability at roughly 7 days. Nevertheless, the average number of raining days in Canberra jump suddenly to an exact 10 days between June and August, exceeding the figure for Canberra before dropping to about 7 days by the end of the period."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.\nIt is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients\u2019 nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.\nContemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people\u2019s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people\u2019s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people\u2019s attention to them, which could grow their connections."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: People have always desired to improve their external features. However, while the time went by, methods of changing appearance for the better have significantly changed. Today, more and more people decide to improve the way they look via cosmetic surgery. In the following essay I'm going to speculate on the topic and explain some possible reasons of this trend.\nObviously, there are plenty of reasons of this tendancy. To start with, operation is an easy way of improving your appearance. People are attracted by this method because they don't need to go to the gym or control their diet anymore. The only thing they need is to call a special doctor and pay money. In addition, it's obvious that every trend is caused by the changes of standarts in society. Nowadays, the number of people who are sure that unnatural beauty is attractive is growing every day. Affected by the opinion of their friends or family members more and more women decide to use surgery in order to change face or other part of the body.\nPersonally, I strongly believe that this bandwagon both worsens the way people look harms health as well. I'm convinced that nothing can surpass natural beauty; meanwhile, every medical operation goes against people's organism and spills what was created by the universe. For example, some famous artists who have used cosmetic surgery in order to stay young are now looking like dolls. What's more, sometimes chemicals which are used during such operations can cause awful consequences for not only people's appearance, but for their health as well. I can still remember a story of one boy who wanted to swell his muscles in a shorter way by using some medecine but, as a result, he appeard in a hospital with serious blood illness due to inappropriate choice and careless usage.\nTaking everything into account, it's my firm conviction that even though cosmetic surgery seems to be a proper way of improving appearance, it is very overrated. On the contrary, such operations do not only worsen the way people look , but can be extremely dangeraus for their organism as well, while natural beauty is here to stay forever."

On the other hand, Canberra reached its lowest temperature and more than a week of rain in the months of June and July.\nBrisbane reached a 30 degrees Celsius temperature in February which is about 3 degrees higher than Canberra. Canberra experienced its coldest temperature about 1 degree Celsius, in June and July in the same month Canberra received 10 days of rainfall.\nAlthough both cities encountered almost the same temperature in the months of March and December, which is in contrast to the number of rainfalls received. There is about a 6 day difference in March and around 7 days in June.\nThat would be the end of the report about the temperature and average rainfall experienced in two Australian cities."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.\nIn my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.\nThe favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.\nThere are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.\nTo conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body."

Netherlands produced the highest amount during the 3 years compared to its counterpart, whereas Guatemala produced the lowest.\nLooking to the table in more detail, the litres of milk produced by Netherlands were superior the tree years compared to the other countries. For example, in 2000 the country made 11,155,000 litres, and in 2010 11,466,000. Australia followed the trend for the first 10 years. However, its production decreased slightly in 2010, for almost 2,060,000 fewer litres than in 2000.\nAdditionally, Tanzinian and Guatemalan production, which also grew over the years, showed lowest amount of milk compared with the highest, Netherlands and Australia. For instance, Tanzania went up from 87,000 in 1990 to 155,000 litres in 2010, almost the double. Guatemala, similarly, rose the numbers of litres from almost four times as much as in 1990, reaching a total of 84,000 litres in 2010."

Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.\nOne of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.\nOn the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.\nIn my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.\nIn conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship."

All children have diffrent ideas and preferences. So that many parenets think what should they provide and organize for their kids or not.\nChildren have free mind. Sometimes that make out of control their behaviours. In this modern world, we have so manyv tools to connect to out side of their world, for example internet, social network. If parents are not organised to kids's freet time, children have so many chance to take those tools. Not all internet stuffs are bad, but also there are lots of appropriate contents for kids around. Kids should be protected and orverviewed by parents or caregivers whatever they are doing. Moreover, if they are not controlled their free time by parents, kids never have limit of spending time for something they are into it. Time management is important for kids, free time shouldn't be until late night.\nOn the other hand, what will be happned if parents don't organised their free time.\nKids are using their imagination or ideas in their free time to play. There is no organising stuff from parents, so that they might try to find what they need and want to do. Therefore, they develop their indepndence and social skills.\nIn my opinion, I think kids should be organised their free time by parents. Compared with both side of effect, I personally choose kids's safety rather than developping independence. Independence and social skills can develop in other situation also. Howevere, kids\"s safety cant choose"

Overall, throughout the years, the Netherlands topped the chart, followed by Australia, Tanzania, and Guatemala. While the amount of milk produced in Tanzania and Guatemala eased up, Australia produced fewer milk as the time went by.\nAmong the countires, the dairy produced in the Netherlands and Australia were much higher than the other two. The number of litres produced in the Netherlands slightly fluctuated but remained the highest, which were all in the eleven millions. On the other hand, the Australian also started in their eleven millions in 1990 and 2000 but drastically plunged to nine millions in 2010.\nMeanwhile, Tanzania began significantly lower at 87,000 litres in 1990, leaped up to 142,000 in 2000 and continued to edged up to 155,000 litres in 2010. At the bottom of the table, stood Guatemala which produced only 26,000 litres in 1990.

                "content": "Question: Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: Apart from education, leisure is an essential part that helps children to discover their interests and develop both physical and mental abilities. While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.\nTo begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.\nDespite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.\nAll in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests. However, these decisions must be reviewed and approved by the parents to ensure the budget added and security of the children themselves."

Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nAnswer: I agree with both: many activities must be organise by parents as kids have not much knowledge about what to do sometimes.\nFreedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.\nCristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.\nAlso depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.\nChildren's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...\nParents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...\nAt the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet."

Surprisingly, people of the age group 61-75 pay only 2% for restaurants and hotels and spent nearly 12 times of former money(23%) to entertain themselves, which was twice the expenditure of the age groups 46-60 and over 76, respectively."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .\n\nAnswer: Young people in some countries are encouraged to take one gap year to work or travel abroad between their high school and university studies. This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.\nTo start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to this journey. First and foremost, they can encounter some dangerous situations, such as being scammed, robbed, and even physically harmed. Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed. It could be dangerous for them if they meet local gangster bands and have no one to rescue them. Therefore, it is essential that young people take precautions to keep their safety while abroad.\nTo sum up, although there are potential risks in the one-year journey, the advantages of broadening their horizons of thoughts, becoming open-minded, and experiences of forming new friendships with people in other countries could outweigh the disadvantages if the young people take measures for their safety while abroad."

Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.\nFood and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.\nIn addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .\n\nAnswer: In other nations, after graduation in high school, youth are encouraged to go overseas for travel or to find a job for a period of one year prior to enrollment in universities for continuing studies. Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.\nMoreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.\nHowever, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities. Another would be waste of time, because instead of finishing studies on time in a university, students might be delayed in their graduation because of a year spent in vacation. As a consequence, timeline in studying and getting a degree is longer than usual."

The trend of expenses for restaurant and hotel had a slight decrease before falling significantly and going up, while that of entertainment had tend to be completely opposite.\nIn the first category, the percentage of expenditure on restaurant and hotel of the age group under 30 was the highest at nearly 15%. In the next age groups, there was a slight decrease at around 12%, respectively group 31 to 45 and group 46 to 60. The figure for this category reached a bottom at 2% of the age group 61 to 75 before climbing sharply to 7% in the age group 76 plus.\nIn the next category, this trend of the budget for entertainment was the opposite totally with demand for restaurant and hotel and reached a peak at nearly 23% in the age group 61 to 75.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .\n\nAnswer: The gap year is an issue that has sparked debate. It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.\nOn the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. In order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. Nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. Besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.\nOn the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.\nTo sum up, the gap year will bring more experiences for young people. It is my belief that the advantages outweigh the others."

Overall, it can be clearly seen that while the popularity of food and drink, and entertainment increased as people got older, the demand for restaurant and hotel changed in the opposite direction.\nTurning to the first main feature, people who were under 30 years old were the majority group that spent on restaurant and hotel, amounting to just below 15% of the total spending, whereas older people in the 61-75 age group spent on this category the least, accounting for approximately 2%. In addition, there was a little more than 10% of the total spending which was contributed by people who were in the 31-45 and 46-60 age group equally.\nTurning to another main feature, in terms of food and drink, there was only just above 5% of the total spending, paid by people who were under 30 years old. Nevertheless, the expenditure ratio rose as the number of age was higher. The largest proportion of spending on food and beverage was about 23%, contributed by people who were 76 years old or over.\nFocusing further on the last category (entertainment), the proportion of the total disbursement grew when people were older. There was just a little more than 5%, spent by people who were below 30 years old on entertainment. However, the ratio of the spending on entertainment rose to around 23% for people who were in 61-75 age group, which is the highest percentage and also the same number as that for people in more-than-76 age group who spent on food and beverage."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .\n\nAnswer: Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.\nIt is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles\u2019 development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.\nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working."

                "content": "Question: The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.\nIt is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.\nIn spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English."

Overall, the statistic reported that students from Australia came to Europe countries stayed fluctuated depended on each nation. The amount of students who moved to Europe from Australia in 2009 is stable to the amount of students leaving abroad from Australia in the year 2007. Therefore, the analysis shows a comparison in which students in Europe prefer moving foward to Australia rather than staying in their area and students in Australia prefer to keep going in their nation than trvel abroad. Some demonstrations can be illustrated. Majorly, countries export their students from Europe frequently owns a higher amount of students who travel abroad to Australia in both years, whereas, the estimated amount of students in Australia who travel to foreigner's universities is less than from Europe in the both 2007 and 2009.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Nowadays, English is commonly demonstrating its' efficiency for the understanding of knowledge in variety of fields, such as economy, biology, psychology, politic and an abundance in opportunity for jobs and employments. Human with their awareness, cognition reveal that the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. I agree with this statement. Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language. Moreover, English is a both logical and basic international language, throughout years of developing, English with its' improvements in meanings and pronunciations, is recognized as a familiarity to everyone, it is gradually becoming easier and not too complicated for people to learn, as a result, English can expedite the problem of language barrier and easily becomes a global language. Furthermore, English as an international language with its' ease and uncomplicated structures can get people the opportunity to get themselves their employment, since English is already known as a popularity in ways of interacting with languages, verbal communication, if English can be spreaded, it can cure the problems of unemployment and a lack of work force. In summarize, English is an amazing language, with its' growth, we can hope for a better perspective, and for a better communication."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: There is no doubt that these days more people is learning and talking by English language. The question is, is this viral of English has a negative view or not? In this essay I will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.\nIn terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before . In other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking English or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .To illustrate, If you are travelling to Italy you don't have to learn Italian language your English will be enough. Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.\nMoreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.\nIn conclusion, although this spread of English may diminish other languages, but still having English language is important. That's why I believe that using English is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues."

Over the period of two years, more exchange students from European universities study in Australia.\nAccording to the first table, it is apparent that total number of students study from universities in Europe to Australia increase between 2007 to 2009, where it accounts from 189 to 226 people. Among all the Europeans countries, the number of exchange students from Germany to Australia rises significantly over the span of two years. The number of students there climbs to almost triple of the original number of students in 2007. However, the second table clearly shows the total number of exchange students from Australia universities to universities in Europe from 2007 to 2009 remain the same, reaching 152 numbers of students.\nWe can see from the two tables below, both the amounts of students from universities in Europe to Australia in 2007 and 2009 are bigger than the amounts of students from Australia universities to European universities, in which the number of students from universities in Europe to Australia in 2009 is the biggest of all, having 226 students study in Australia, whereas in 2009, only 152 students goes from Australia universities to universities in Europe."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.\nEnglish should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.\nIn addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.\nIn conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nAnswer: Since the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.\nTo go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.\nFortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app \"Club House\" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.\nIn contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, \"Icelandish\" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.\nFinally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.\nIn conclusion, English will continuously spread worldwide."

Specifically, these are the countries that are more willing, than unwilling, to eat insect products: Mexico (71%), Peru (58%), Thailand (56%). It may perhaps be that these countries already consume insects as part of their diet. If this is case, it may explain their greater willingness to consume insect products.

The highest cost is of beef at 3.03 USD/kg, as compared to the lowest costing insect - giant water bug at 2.6 USD/kg. Due to the dieteray norms in the United States, people are more likely to be acqainted with eating and preparing beef, as opposed to the giant water bug - and it may provide nutritional benefits that are difficult to be found in relatively smaller animals such as insects. Overall, the range for purchasing insects as food products is from 10.65 USD/kg to 2.6 USD/kg, while non-insect products are overall more inexpensive, ranging from 0.78 USD/kg to 3.03 USD/kg."

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.\nI have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.\nI have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again."

According to recent research on the willingness to consume insects as food, it shows that the countries likely to accept insect products are Mexico with 71% of people willing to eat insects, followed by Peru and Thailand, which have 58% and 56 % of the population accept the idea. While Russia, Australia and USA against having bug-based foods the most that only 32%, 34% and 35% of the general public are willing to taste insects.\nHowever, it is doubtful that utilizing insect-based food is a solution to the food crisis. The research also stated the market price of insects. The general price of insects is at least double compared to plant-based food like rice. The price of some kinds of insects like weaver ants and bamboo caterpillars is even triple the price compared to beef. Having bugs as a new protein source is still a question mark at this moment."

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Having insects as food is not a new idea. In some Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand and Columbia, bugs like spiders and grasshoppers are common protein sources for the general public. To solve the food shortage in the growing population around the world, there is a voice to consume insect-based products instead of traditional meats. Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?\nFirst of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.\nFood safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.\nNevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects. Whichever sources of the insects are safe and eco-friendly, insects can be a subsidy of proteins when lacking meat sources. However, there is still a long road for insects to become the main source of food in this state."

While most countries are against insects consumption, Peru is, by far, more willing to shift to eat bugs. Overall, insects price per kilogram are much higher than majority of other ingredients available.\nLooking into details, Mexico is the only country that has high rate of willingness on bugs consumption at 71%, followed by Peru and Thailand where the rates are slightly higher than half of their population. Meanwhile, although only upto 89% of Japaneses refuse to eat insects, India, Russia and the US are not as strongly opposed as their willingness rates are still in thrities as well as China and Brazil whose population over forties can try to consume bugs as substitutes.\nOn the other hand, compared to current available food sources, the most expensive bugs, which is weaver ant, costs 10.65 USD per kilograms which is more than triple the price of beef. The female giant water bug which is costed the least, at 2.6 USD per kilogram, is still only 40 cents cheaper than beef, the most expensive current protein source."

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Among all of global issues, food shortage can clearly be seen as one of the most concerning as the ultimate result of this issue is hunger and death which is relatable to all. One of the solution being brought into spotlight is consuming insects. While some people believe that this can be a proper path to end the world's hunger, others argue that it will further lead new problems.\nTo begin with, there are various aspects of advantages in using bugs as protein substitutes. Bugs are not only available in all continents but the majority of them have short life cycles. If farms shift to grow insects rather than the currently available lifestock, less costs and investments will be needed as they only need weeks to mature while other lifestocks require months or even years. Then, what prevent the humanity to covert to insectivore?\nAs well as tremendous benefits, the idea of consuming athropods can raise numbers of concerns. Introduction of new insect species and increase of their populations can extremely affect native ecosystem. To elaborate this, alien species introduced from one area to another can be dangerously invasive and can ultimately result in extinction of native species. One example is gold fish which were released into lakes can multiply their populations in short period and over the years, they doubled in size and eradicated their counterparts in original food chain. Therefore, arthropods which are much smaller and aglier can effortlessly escape farms and survive in extreme environment will cause disasters to the nature and crops in the farming areas.\nAll in all, consumption of insects can be humanity's new opportunity to survive as it requires less resources and provides abundant produces. Nevertheless, this change in food source require more researches to ensure sanitary and nutritions as well as time for the consumers' adaption to the new concept."

Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.\nIt is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs."

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Food is one of the the most essential need for human beings. As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand. A huge percentage of the world population are experiencing starvation and nutrients deficiency. In order to solve world hunger issues, providing edible insects as an option for food could be a feasible solution.\nChicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature. Although small, they are a significant part of the ecosystem. Making insects a food option would decrease their numbers which could create crucial changes that we are not prepared for.\nHowever, using edible insects as a food option would help to provide a bigger and wider range of choices for the world population. As the population grows, it is only logical to also increase the food supply. Furthermore, there are countries across the globe with high willingness to try insects as a food option. If we utilize this data accordingly, we may be able to provide an additional option to countries that would like to try them.\nIn conclusion, people in many parts of the world are not ready to consume edible insects. In my opinion, raising awareness on reducing meat consumerism may be easier and a more feasible solution to the problem. It is evident that our societies need more research on insects as food product."

One of the most important matters nowadays is eating insects and unhealthy sources of natural food. Some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.\nhowever, there is some cultivating support that comes from insects which is a positive impact on the land or cultivating areas. Such as, it helps plants to grow fast and healthier. Many people use insects in their cultivating land as organic manure. it reduces dying trees and plants and provides enough energy and nutrition to plants to grow faster, healthier, and keep fresh. All over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. By using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.\nFor some people, eating insects is so common and reliable but it gives a lot of bad experiences when it publishes negative reactions in the human body. some people suffer from eating insects a lot. sometimes it gives people nutrition and energy as they believe but sometimes it is just the worst scenario having or eating insects such as diarehuiya,colleriahuia, and common bacterial issues in the human body. Mostly it happens when people are not enough insured of using or knowing how to process insects and make them ready to eat."

From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.\nThe message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network."

Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.\nAnother reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.\nLast but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.\nIn conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management."

A neuron cell consists of four three parts, these are the Cell body, Action potential, and the Terminal buttons.\nStart with the Cell Body, otherwise known as the soma, it has shape of small ball in its center with tree-roots like lines surrounding it. These lines are called the Dendrites, and theu are responsible for the communication between the neurons. The Dendrites send and recive messages between neurons when physically contacting with each other.\nThe second part that forms the neuron, is called the Action potential. This section of the neuron consist of the Axon and the Myelin sheath. First of all, the Axon, which is formed as long line extending from the Dendrites, is considred the communication bridge between the cell body and other neurons, muscles, or glands. The second part og the Action potential, is the Myelin sheath cylinders, which are connected with each other as a chain. The Myelin sheath is responsible for covring the Axcon for protection and speeding up the neural impluses.\nLastly, the last part of the neuron is the Terminal buttons, this part recives the neural impluses from the Axcon and form junctions with other cells to send the message."

This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.\nFirst of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.\nNevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.\nTo summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder."

It\u00b4s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.\nAccording to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.\nIn regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out"

I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.\nIn regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.\nBy contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens\u00b4 life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.\nIn conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only."

The island is approximately less than 200 metres in length and a little under 80 metres in width.\nBefore the construction of tourist facilities, the island was desolated with no man made units whatsoever with vegetations sparsely grown in clumps all over the island. This changed after 15 housing units were constructed in 2 big circles on either side of the island. There is a reception building in the middle of the island and a restaurant up North. The barren land now have footpaths and vehicle tracks all around, increasing transport efficiency. The beach and the body of water near it has been turned into a swimming area. A pier has also been built on the South side of the island, with 2 sailboats docked.\nOverall, there is a major increase in the number of housing units placed on the island and the number of footpath and vehicle tracks for a more efficient transport to the housing units, restaurant and beach. The East side of the island was untouched both before and after the construction of tourist facilities."

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: My custom topic: It is important for people to take risks, in both their professional lives and personal lives.\nDo the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?\nI personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.\nFirstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.\nSecondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.\nAlthought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.\nOverall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring."

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.\nFirstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.\nSecond, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.\nOverall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy."

It lays one or two eggs every three days, as it's written below.\nA bee's egg is small and fragile, the bee puts it in a place where it won't fall or go with the wind.\nAs for the bee egg hatching mechanism, the egg needs to hatch after nine to ten days, in order to complete the growth of the little bee.\nThe bee hatches on the fifth day after leaving the egg, the young bee begins to grow up on its seventh day after the hatching stage.\nThe little bee turns into a nymph, and the nymph begins to milt three times as it grows.\nNymph grow and transform into a young adult bee, then the young adult bee needs four days to mature.\nAnd it becomes a full growth bee and performs its functions in the nature.\nAnd this process continues among the bees."

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: The economic progress is an increase in the capability of a society to produce higher valued ( more and better ) goods and services with the use of the same or equivalent resources.\nThe benefits of economic growth include higher average incomes. Economic growth enables consumer to consume more goods and services and enjoy better standards of living.\nThe economic progress is an important goal for governments, because firstly, a healthy economy results in job creations, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services.\nAnother progress is important for a country, in my point of view, technical progress or technology in general is very important for a country, in many bases.\nThe technological progress refers to the discovery of new and improved methods of producing goods.\nThe term process technology refers to chemical processing used to refine raw materials into finished products. For example, process technology is used to refine crude oil.\nTechnological prosperity also lies in global purposes, so for military purposes and war technique, are important in terms of preparation and possessing advanced weapons.\nAnd also for local and domestic or personal purposes, for example use of modern devices, and networks of the fifth generation ( 5G ).\nThere are many other types of important progresses, as industrial progress, architectural progress, commercial progress and civilization progress.\nIt all complements each other at the end. And all of them are of particular importance."

The first stage is where the female honey bee lay 1 or 2 eggs every three days span, which then followed by hatching the eggs after 9 to 10 days before the bee breaks the egg after 5days. These are the stages where bee grows inside the egg.\nThe next stages of life cycle is where the honey bees grow outside the eggshells. After they are hatched, they start growing in size at 5 days and 9 days, and the nymph moults 3 times as it grows. Later 9 days, the young adults emerge which are ready for maturity in 4 days. It is clearly seen this then connected to female laying eggs"

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: It is often argued that economic progress is the ultimate goal for most governments, while others suggest that there are other factors that contribute the country's progress. In my opinion, I believe that apart from economy, government should also consider other types of progress which also consider other types of progress which give equal importance to a nation.\nfirst of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.\nDesipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities. As a reason, the country's government should also focus more on other factors leading to progress.\nIn conclusion, I believe that government should not solely goal for economic growth but also concentrate on other factors which are equally important for a country's growth."

It is convenient living in a big cities as you could be close to work, or have variety of choices when eating out, many people choose to live in a city. However, there are people who believe that there could be some health concerns by living in big cities. This could be ture to some extent, but I do not agree compeletely with this openion.\nOne of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings. This will encourage people to commute by public transportations. As a result, you could see less cars on the road in the cities.\nThere are also a health concerns coming from having less exercise. However, usually, ther are many gyms in the city. Also, many cities tend to have a big park or walking track, wher people can go for walks and jogs.\nHowever, I agree that people living outside the cities, especialy wher surrounded by natures will have more cleaner air. Also having more space to exercise, compare to people living in cities may assist in being able to maintain their health.\nSome people thinks that it is not good for people's health to live in big cities. However, environmental facts varies depending on each cities. I believe thath people can still live healthy as much as people living in a suburban areas, if the trafic is significantly heavy compare to other area of the coutries, of have an opportunities to exercise regularly."

Overall, shared areas were minimized and more rooms were built to increase the accommodation's capacity.\nIn 2010, the building was surrounded by a garden. There were 3 student bedrooms, each located away from the others. When entering the main entrance, the first student bedroom was on the left side, followed by the bathroom. At the end of the hallway, stood the second bedroom. Turning to the left, the last bedroom was on the other end with the kitchen in between the two bedrooms. If you turned another left, you would find the living room beside the bedroom.\nThroughout the years, a carpark was built on the right side of the main entrance through the building's length. While the three student bedrooms remain the same, an additional en-suite room was constructed in the hallway beside the second bedroom. The kitchen is now integrated with the social area. Moreover, two more student bedrooms were built next to the third bedroom, one replacing the livingroom and another being developed over the garden area near the walkway."

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.\nTo begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.\nAnother undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.\nAll in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life."

It has been developed with a lot more bedrooms.\nIn 2010, the premises was surrounded by a lot of greenery, which has been replaced by more student-bedrooms and car parking now. There were only 3 bedrooms back in 2010, but at present there are 5 bedrooms including an en-suite room next to one of the bedrooms. There was no sign of car parking back in 2010.\nAnother major change that we can see from 2010 to at present is disappearance of the living room. However, a small area which is named as social area have come up in place of the living room. The social area is a part of the kitchen, which obviously made the kitchen smaller compared to that of 2010. Due to an en-suite room, the size of the hallway also has been reduced."

However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.\nThe main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.\nAnother reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health. Living in a continuous stress without taking care of the health leads to many health problems.\nTo conclude, the life in a big city is very stressful, busy and surrounded with a lot of pollution, which is not good for health of an individual."

The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.\nNow, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.\nIn conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold"

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people\u2019s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals\u2019 health conditions.\nUndoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants\u2019 health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.\nHowever, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals\u2019 mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.\nFurthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens\u2019 health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens\u2019 health conditions can be diminished physically.\nIn conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individuals\u2019 mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine people\u2019s health."

As for the garden to the right of the hallway, it was transformed to the car parking. The hallway area has reduced significantly due to the fresh built en-suite room that is now adjacent to the student-bedroom in the end of the hallway. The kitchen now includes a social area for students. The bathroom opposite to kitchen did not change at all. The living room left to the bathroom is now transformed to another student-bedroom with the passage leading to the room on the right, and its indoor entrance has shifted to the left. The part of the garden behind a former livingroom was turned into additional student-bedroom with two entraces: the first entry is located outdoors, while the second is available only indoors."

In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.\nA row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.\nOn the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.\nTo sum up, living in megapolice can possibly extend your life, but for me the quality of this life is still doubtful."

The first one illustrate its condition in 1998 and second gives details from 2008.\nAccording to the pictures, there has been significant alterations in some areas of museum whereas at some points no clear change has been done. Overall some areas benefited from an increase in total area and some exhibited decline in such category.\nThe areas taken from permanent exhibition rooms were allocated to form restarurant in the upper left corner of museum. In addition to that, some parts of the garden became cafe sitting area in front of the cafe. More than that, the fountains were added to the garden also. The WC part of the museum transferred to the place next to cafe and temporary exhibition room were moved to the left middle of the museum.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Despite to the presence of vast amount of translation programs on computers and other electronic devices, it is still considered more beneficial in terms of learning language itself. In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.\nThe utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.\nAnother benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.\nThe third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.\nIn a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be."

It can be clearly seen that the area of permanent exhibition was decresed and more additional facilities appeared.\nGetting back to the details, facilities that had been placed to the right of the entrance were replaced by a part of permanent exhibition. Shop and room for keeping bags and coats were transfer to the left side instead room for temporary exhibitions and the new WC was opened inside cafe area. Tempopary exhibition room is currantly located to the left of garden and restaurant was opened juat beyond this exhibition room. The space of current temporary exhibition room and restaurant was previously occupied by permanent exhibition. So this space was decreased after modernisation of the museum.\nThe garden placed in the centre of the museum was also modernised. There are cafe sitting area and fountains now in the garden."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.\nFirst of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.\nAnother important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.\nMoreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.\nFinally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.\nTo sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work."

The first section is to summarising the information by selecting and reporting the main features.Making comparions where relevant is the main context in the second section.\nFirstly,I am going to summarize the two plan comparatively.Viewing the plan in 1998,several large areas in the museum were for Permannent Exhibition Rooms,located in the both sides of the museum.The other funtions of the museum, such as Tickets Ebtrance,shop and so on, gathered in the south part of the museum.As for the plan in 2008, the Permannent Exhibition Rooms were placed in the east side of the museum.The other funtion were arranged in the east side.\nFinally,I will make comparisons between them.The isolation of different funtions in the 2008's plan was clearer than the isolation in 1998's plan. What's more, comparing with the plan in 1998, 2008's garden had more functions,including cafe sitting area and fountains.\nThat'all my report."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: I totally agree with above opinion.With the development of the Internet technique and the receiving device.A lot of translation software are available.But I believe that learing a language personally is still necesssary for us.\nI used to use translation software when I read essay and see a film.But It make me realize the importance of language learning that I made an academic mistake in my writing of the absract ,due to using the translation translated by softwate immidiately without checking,which make my pay in vain. I had to rewrite the abstract.However, my poor English made the process difficult.Having experienced that, I strongly feel that translation software is not the best way to use language.Only when languege stepping in our mind, can we use language truly.\nThe one of the main usage of language is communication,meanwhile,speaking is the most effective way to communicate with each other.If we comunicate with English speaker by using the translation software, it may be ineffective and even make miskakes.So if we have oppotunities to learn a languge,we should take action.\nTranslation software doesn't decline the need of language learning .opposively,it is benefit for the language learning.When we come across some words unknown,using,translation software is more convient than referring to the dictionary.\nIn a word,the wide use of the translation software dosen't mean that we don't need to learn language.What we should do is use the software critically with the accumulation with language learning.We are the owner of the tools ,not a slaver of a tool.We should keep our independace in some fields."

Next to the entrance, there is a space for a shop and a toilet.\nRegarding to the changes in the present plan in 2008, the spacious permanent room was converted to a temporary exhibition room and a restaurant. The tickets area and garden remained in the same position. Nonetheless, the central garden was decorated by building two fountains and a cafe sitting area. The east wing of the complex was entirely allocated to three separate permanent exhibition rooms. Furthermore, the shop was moved to west side of the entrance, and the WC was rebuild next to cafe in the north end."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Despite several translation programmes exist on different platforms, studying and acquiring the essential rules of a language has more benefits. Owing to limited usefulness of translation softwares in daily life, to large extent, \u0131 agree with this statement. However, educationalists may use these programmes as supporting management systems for academical purposes.\nA growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills. Individuals from different sociocultural or educational levels frequently utilise these open-access and easily understandable operating systems. Moreover, some teachers recommend their use to promote the learning process of primary school pupils. Last but not least, because translating a sheet by using these programmes is less time-consuming and free of charge, its use is gaining popularity among young individuals with regard to academic communication and correspondence.\nOn the other hand, the utility of these file management systems are questioned by some experts in the field of philology. Some linguistic scientists stated that translation supporting systems distracts children\u2019s motivation and eagerness to learn the grammatical rules of a language. Additionally, while these operating tools have benefits in terms of easening the written communication, it has no practical advantage or use in verbal interaction. From my point of view, softwares should not be introduced to children before learning basics of a language and gaining an intermedicate level of spoken and written vocabulary.\nIn conclusion, although translation softwares have limited benefits such as costeffectivity and usability, it should be restricted as a complementary tool for people with a significant background and knowledge of a language, and the advantages of learning a language including practicality in face to face communication clearly outweighs."

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.\n\nAnswer: The figure shows plans of a museum in 1998 and in 2008, after suffering some changes. The main differences in both plans are the layout of the building and the addition of new facilities.\nIn 1998, once you entered the museum you would first encounter the entrance/ exit and the thickets shop. On the left, there was a temporary exhibition room and on the right, there was a shop, the bathroom and a bags and coat hanger.\nAt that time the museum had three permanent exhibition rooms: one on the left, next to the temporary exhibition room, and two on the right, adjacent to the shop and WC.\nSeparating 2 exhibition rooms, at the top of the plan, there was a cafe. All the spaces mentioned surrounded a central garden.\nSimilar to 1998, in 2008, people would find a ticket shop in the space designated as an entrance and exit. However, on the left, now is a permanent exhibition room, whereas on the right there's a shop and a bags and coat hanger. The museum still possesses three permanent exhibition rooms, all of them on the right side of the building.\nOn the left side, adjacent to the shop and hanger there's a temporary exhibition room and next to it a restaurant. At the top of the plan, there's a cafe and a bathroom next to the restaurant and one of the permanent exhibition rooms, respectively.\nJust like in 1998, there's a central garden. However, this garden now has new components such as fountains and a cafe sitting area close to the cafe.\nIn conclusion, the museum in 2008 is much more modern and developed than in 1998. In fact, the building became a facility that welcomes not only people interested in visiting the many exhibitions but also those that just want to have a meal or a cup of coffee in the garden with friends."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.\nFirst of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.\nIn fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.\nFurthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.\nOne of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, \"Saudade\" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.\nBesides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.\nLastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.\nTo illustrate this, when talking to the AI \"Siri\" on the iPhone or \"Alexa\" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.\nIn conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated."

Both diagrams show that the Entrance/Exit and ticketing space stayed the same in 2008 as in 1998. On the right of the ticketing counter for the 1998 floor plan we see spaces split for the shop, WC, and storage space for bags and coats. The temporary exhibition room is located on the left of the entrance/exit and seems smaller in 1998 as compared to the area we see for the temporary exhibition room we see in the 2008 plans. The 2008 floor plan shows the shifting of the storage space for bags and coats and the shop to the left of the ticketing counters. The right hand side space in the 2008 plans is being used as part of the permanent exhibition rooms.\nThe 1998 floor plans show that the permanent exhibition rooms, and the cafe, as well as the temporary exhibition room, ticketing counter, and shop were situated around a central garden. The cafe split the permanent exhibition rooms into two sides of the garden. The 2008 changes in the plans indicate that while the permanent exhibition rooms were moved to be on right side of the garden, a portion of garden was carved out to work as a sitting area for the cafe. A restaurant was also added next to the cafe right past the temporary exhibition room which is now sits on the other left side of the garden. The garden was renovated to include two new water features in the form of fountains. The WC is now located next to the cafe adjoining the permanent exhibition rooms."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!\nThis is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.\nComing from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.\nLater on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.\nIn conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill."

Some argue that routine behavior is adequate for spending their life, by others do not agree with this thought. This essay will attempt to provide a brief analysis.\nFirst of all, it is a fact that people feel comfortable to being and doing things that they being familiar with, by fixing routine in every day we can make our life certain and manageable. For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.\nHowever, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation. Encouraging new challenges in life could give us to develop and explore new skills or new ways of thought. From my experience, I recently tried to play a new sport that I never thought I will in love with, which is golf. It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.\nIn summary, I would say that the advantage of doing new things outweigh the disadvantage of its. Sometimes we have to take a risk to walk in the alternative way, maybe we could get new goolife we could never imagine for"

Conversely, the thirds others brands, sold few mobile so far.\nFirstly, Samsung increased these own sales each by at least 20, from 230 in 2019 to 450 in 2013. On the other hand, Nokia started with roughtly 450 in 2009 to drop out sharply to 250 in 2013.\nOn the other side, Apple began with a little bit quantity from 25 to go up to 150. In comparison, LG drop down until 80. In overwhole, global sales of ZTE remain the same between these three years, with between 50 and 60 of phone sales.\nTo conclude, the graph shows us, 2 majors concurent in the market and in the other side, 3 brands who try to catch up part of the market."

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: It is difficult to establish new routine, but sometime it is important. Some people think, that is it important to change our daily life. Conversely, other thinks that does not matter at all and, do not want to change. In my point of view, I think it is difficult to change. However, we have a lot of environmental issues last decade, therefore, we need to change.\nLearn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.\nOn the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.\nTo conclude, to change is important because in our century we have big issues. But as we seen there are no explicit reason to change if there are no problem and we are happy in our life."

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.\nChanging it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.\nOther people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.\nIn conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing."

This essay will descraibe both saids and draw my personal conclusion.\nFirst of all, when we live on same schudale for all days that mean the tommorw we know what we do. For example, the person he work on any spicalist and he know what will do next day because it is same like the week before, and he like that and feel comforte for his live. So in the end, the fixed routine that will be the goal for some people.\nSecond of all, when the next day or next week it is not the same of this moment or before! that descraibe there is new experince or maybe new challinges will be see that front of us. To illustrate, many men or womans they likes to wake up on the morning to see what they have new for those day. And for this people they get more energy and very excited for the new morning on they lives.\nIn addition, I saw some persons they like when they in work want to live on same routine but on weekend they belived the change is better to got or put new information, experince, or anything that diffrent for the bast week. So, they like the routine and change.\nIn conclusion, after carfuly analysis, I belive the change it is better for me and for humanity because there is so many thing we must to be learn about it and that will be come when we change or routine."

Natural catastrofes like flooding, huracanes and many others don\u00b4t occure every day, anticipation is key. The diagrams show how houses can be protected in areas wich are prone to flooding.\nThe diagrams show on the one hand where there is a stopbank and on the other hand where there is no stopbank. To raise buildings ais very important in this matter. Ground level and flood level must be taken in account.\nThe starting point is the ground level that must be mesure against the 100-year flood level. The boulding must be raised from the ground level so that the house florr level is 300 mm above the 100-year flood level. The river/dam and the internal runoff are the extreme factores.\nBoth diagrams show how to prevent bouldings from flooding with the main difference of of the stopbank."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: There are several systems of education, some of them more efficients than others. Students of today are the proffessionals of tomorrow and thus is very important they recibe a propper education. In my opinion we should divide students based on their academic ability.\nIf we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.\nOn the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.\nEducation should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.\nIn my personal expirience I shared classrooms with students that had special needs and teachers educate them in different ways than the rest of as. These special students have different learning times and needed more atenttion from their teachers. On the other hand, some students were very smart with great academic abilities and some of them had some behaviour troubles becouse they got bored at class, I remmember one student named Jackson Bell who was brilliant and was sent to the school physicologist due to behaviour problems(he hit other students) and if teachers have gaived Jackson the extra attention he needed that wouldn\u00b4t happen."

The presence of the stopbank allow a reduction of the water level. Moreover, another relevant feature of the stopbank is the presence of the floodgate. This makes possible the exit of the water in excess. Indeed, internal runoff could cause an incontrolled increase of the water level. Thus, the floodgate is very important to mantain stable the level of water. Regardless of the presence of the stopbank, buildings should not touch the ground. They should be elevated in order to allow a higher level of the water without causing damages to the houses.\nIn conclusion, it seems clear that a stopbanck could be a safeguards for buildings which are built in areas prone to flooding."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Nowadays, a topic often discussed is the education and its relation with the difference in people's ability and possibilities. According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.\nPeople that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.\nThe other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the \"best\" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.\nTo conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability. But if you want to educate people as humankind you should not divide the class."

The first one is using a stopbank. The other one is raising the house under the 100 year flood level. Also we can use a mix of them.\nAccording to the picture, the stopbank is a useful way to prevent flooding by building a little dump between the house and the river. Before constructing it we should know the level of the flood around the previous 100 years and our dump should be higher. Moreover, the stopbank will make an internal pond which will be created by internal runoff, accordingly we should give water to return back to the river via floodgate.\nAdditionally, it is shown that we could use piles to raise a building above water. In doing this we should carry about 300 mm freeboard between the house flood and the water level."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.\nOn the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.\nOn the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.\nIn conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea."

However for diagram 1 it tells us that the water level is closer to the ground as compared to diagram 2 so that means it's less likely for the house to get destroyed in diagram 1 compared to diagram 2 this is because there's a stopbank present in diagram 1 to reduce the amount of flooding. The Berm in diagram 1 allows the water to take a steeper path so that it reduces the risk of flooding so that the house in diagram 1 is less likely to get destroyed as compared to the house in diagram 2. In diagram 1 there's a floodgate to control the amount of water flowing and it's not present in diagram 2."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: I believe students should be divided according to their academic ability this is because specific students require different amounts of support according to their abilities.\nStudents that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.\nHowever if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.\nIf students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.\nHowever if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.\nOverall I believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated, they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support."

Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.\nThe first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of \u2018internal ponding.\u2019\nIf it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the \u2018freeboard.\u2019"

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nAnswer: Nowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.\nProponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students\u2019 needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student\u2019s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.\nOthers, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student\u2019s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children\u2019s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.\nIn conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters\u2019 gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead."

It shows the already existing floor plan and the proposed changes made to the floor plan.\nOverall, the main changes that have been made, is that the hall has been removed from the floor to enhance the space of the living room. Meanwhile the kitchen have added furniture in the changed diagram and the doors leading through the kitchen to the living room has changed location.\nThe kitchen in the existing floor plan contained no furniture. Meanwhile the proposed changes to the kitchen added furniture, but made the kitchen overall smaller. The hallway has been completely removed in the revised floor plan, making room for double doors leading into the living room. These alterations in the structure of the floor has expanded the area of the living room, making it more spacious than in the existing floor plan.\nIn conclusion, these changes would remove the hallway from the floor making the living room overall larger."

Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.\nThe most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.\nThe other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home. I hold this opinion since school attendance can enhance childrens social skills and their ability to navigate the world around them."

Therefore, there will be no more wall between the living room and that area that is occupied by the hall at the moment. At the same time the wall between the living room and the kitchen as well as stairs will be moved towards the windowless wall and stairs will be reformatted in a spiral shape.\nSome other less important changes will include installation of kitchen furniture in the kitchen, deployment of 2-pieces door between the living room and the kitchen and removal of the storage space under stairs.\nIn conclusion, it can be stated that the most important change to the ground floor will be it reformatting into 2 rooms. Some other changes will be also implemented with regards to the walls, doors and other items."

While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.\nOn the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.\nOn the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.\nIn conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home"

I think that sending children to school give them a great advantage not only in their academics but also in their development and social skills.\nHaving children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.\nOn the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.\nHowever, in my personal experiece being in a class with a lot of students can be hard. Find the \"right people\" to be with might be challenging but at the end it is satisfying, because you might also end up having friends for life and creating good memories,\nIn conclusion, these two different methods are both acceptable, as long as the child best interest is done, no matter if his being teached at school or at home."
